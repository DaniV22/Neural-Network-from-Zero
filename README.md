# Neural-Network-from-Zero
An implementation of a simple Neural Network from scratch, in Python. This model includes the fundamental features to carry out a regression or classification task. This project has been made for learning purposes.

The model allows us to use a bunch of different activation and loss functions. There are also two distinct optimizers (SDG and Adam) that can be used in the backpropagation to adjust the training process.

We include an additional ipynb file with an example of use for classification and regression.

### Future implementations

* Implement more optimizers, activation and loss functions.
* Grant the model with more customization such as regularization techniques and the ability to disable some neurons (dropout layers).
* To saving and loading the model information after a training.
